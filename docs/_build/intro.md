# Marcus Diaz 

Welcome To Marcus Diaz Documentation 
This is a small sample Documentation book to give show you what my project is about. We implemented splay trees into an express javascript server that suggests autocompletions for searches on the frontend, as well as splaying searches to the top of the autocomplete list for the next time it is accessed. The bulk of the program is run using child processes handled by the express server, which update a text file containing the state of the tree and a json file containing the autocomplete strings. It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out Splay Trees for more information.
