212 Project Solo- Docs focus

Abstract a one paragraph “abstract” type overview of what your project consists of. This should be written for a general audience, something that anyone who has taken up to 211 could understand. It should follow guidance of a scientific abstract.

we explored the fascinating realm of Splay Trees, a self-adjusting binary search tree data structure known for its efficiency in maintaining recently accessed elements near the root. Applying this concept, we developed a word prediction search bar akin to Google's autocomplete feature. The search bar dynamically adapts to user input, predicting and suggesting relevant words based on prior searches. Through extensive research and implementation, we aimed to create an intuitive and responsive user experience, leveraging the adaptability of Splay Trees to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of word predictions in real-time search scenarios. This project not only delves into advanced data structures but also showcases their practical application in creating user-friendly and intelligent search functionalities.


Reflection a one paragraph reflection that summarizes challenges faced and what you learned doing your project

Facing the challenge of organizing a substantial amount of 
code during my project was no small feat.
Navigating through complexities presented consistent roadblocks, 
but with persistent research, these hurdles became more manageable. 
This experience has not only enhanced my technical skills 
but also underscored the significance of perseverance and 
continuous learning in the face of programming challenges.
