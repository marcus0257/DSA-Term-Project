## 212 Project Doc & Developer onboarding

Add documentation website and developer onboarding information to your CSC 212 project. 

### Objectives

<!-- in this section describe the overall goals in terms of what you will learn and the problem you will solve. this should be 2-5 sentences, it can be bullet points/numbered or a paragraph  -->

This project will provide information for a user to use the data structure implemented for a CSC 212 project and for a potential collaborator to add new features to it. The information will live in the repo and be served as a rendered website. 

### Method

 <!-- describe what you will do , will it be research, write & present? will there be something you build? will you do experiments?-->
1. ensure there is API level documentation in the code files
